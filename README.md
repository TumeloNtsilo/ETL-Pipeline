iTunes ETL Pipeline
Project Description

This is a simple ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline built in Python that fetches data about songs from the iTunes API for a specific artist.
The pipeline performs the following steps:

Extract: Retrieves songs by a given artist from the iTunes API.

Transform: Cleans the data, renames columns, and selects only relevant fields like song title, album, release date, genre, and pricing.

Load: Saves the transformed data into a CSV file for easy analysis or use in other projects.
